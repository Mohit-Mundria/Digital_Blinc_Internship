## 📂 Projects

### 📁 `Text Summarizer`

A smart web app that summarizes long passages of text using **Ollama's llama3.2 Model**. Designed to help students, professionals, and researchers quickly condense lengthy information into digestible insights.

**Tech Stack**:  
`Python`, `Streamlit`, `Ollama's llama3.2`

**Features**:
- Clean UI using Streamlit
- Abstractive summarization (not just picking sentences)
- Fast and accurate summaries without needing an API key
- Easy deployment or integration into other apps

### 🧠 Emoji Predictor
**Description**: A fun and practical NLP project that predicts the most appropriate emoji based on a given text message or sentence.  
Useful for chat apps, social platforms, and improving text-based UX.

**Tech Stack**:  
`Python`, `Scikit-learn`, `NLP`, `Logistic Regression / LSTM`, `Streamlit`

**Example**:
- Input: `"I got an A+ on my test!"` → Output: 🎉  
- Input: `"I'm so tired today"` → Output: 😴
